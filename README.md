# PZAI Exposé

The most recent version of this document is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/th-nuernberg/pzai-expose) and
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ctgdqqhnpksb#2bc10c).

The point of this exposé is to demonstrate that you have a good understanding of
what your thesis will be about and what the steps are to get there. Please
discuss your exposé with your advisor to make sure all points are covered. It
will be read by the PZAI Promotionsausschuss (dissertation committee) to
estimate if your research proposal is in line with the overall research agenda
of the PZAI, if depth in terms of computer science and/or math is sufficient,
and if the balance of theoretical and experimental work is adequate.

Expect this document to be about 2-3 pages (depending on figures, tables, ...),
excluding references.
